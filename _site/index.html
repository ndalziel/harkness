<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 1:</b> 
We begin by assessing your current growth trajectory across major business units. 
We analyze the sources of growth, including share of wallet expansion, new customer acquisition, new products, and new markets.
</p>
<p>
<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 2:</b> 
Next, we survey senior executives with targeted questions to understand the strength of existing 
growth processes and capabilities.

<p>
<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 3:</b> 
Finally, we share the quantiative and qualitative analysis with senior executives, along with preliminary 
perspectives on growth opportunities. We refine the prioritization of these growth opportunities in collaboration 
with senior executives.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>

<p>
Most organizations only look a few years into the future. 

Scenario planning provides a long-term perspective. 

It's about looking a decade or more into the future, exploring possible futures,  
and assessing their long-term implications - both threats and opportunities - for an organization.
</p>

<br>
<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
We have a robust, structured scenario development process that has proven highly effective 
within large organizations. At the heart of the process is the framing of scenarios around 
the most critical uncertainties faced by the organization. The key steps are as follows:
<p>
<ol>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Define the key decision</b> that need to be made</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Identify key forces</b> in the environment</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Prioritize external forces</b> based on their importance and uncertainty</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Develop scenarios</b> based on combinations of key forces</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Identify implications</b> for the organization</li>
</ol>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
    Strategy is fundamentally about making choices that create a differentiated 
    market position. It sounds easy, but is very hard in practice. Why? 
    Because it involves challenging trade-offs. A shift in strategy requires not 
    only deciding "what to do", but also deciding "what not to do". 
    The organization must put in place a set of inter-locking activities that support 
    their strategic choices. The self-reinforcing nature of the entire activity system 
    makes it hard for competitors to replicate.  
    
</p>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
The core of our strategy development process involves addressing five strategic questions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>What are our goals?</li> 
    <li>Where will we play?</li> 
    <li>How will we win?</li> 
    <li>What capabilities must be in place?</li> 
    <li>What management systems are required?</li> 
</ol>

<p>
    We take a flexible and highly collaborative approach, involving key 
    stakeholders in a process which is adapted to your specific needs. At the heart of 
    the process we define strategic choices, identify key assumptions, and test those
    assumptions through in-depth research and analysis.
    Please get in touch to learn about how we've used this approach to align leadership teams around a compelling strategy.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>We believe there are five key components that need to be part of any business case:
    <ol>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Value</b>: how our offer will create compelling value in the marketplace</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Demand</b>: validation that there is a critical mass of paying customers </li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Supply</b>: the capabilities required to develop the offer</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Unit economics</b>: path towards achieving long-term profitability</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Go-to-market</b>: plan to reach, engage, and win target customers cost-effectively </li>
    </ol>
</p><p>
    Most business cases focus heavily on the supply side - 
    detailing the internal costs of building the new product or business. 
    We take a venture capital perspective to business cases, placing 
    equal focus on validating customer demand and unit economics.
</p>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
 Our approach to developing business cases addresses areas which are often neglected:
<ol>
    <li> <b class = "blue-grey-text">How do we deal with uncertainty?</b><br>
         We believe in the importance of taking a sophisticated approach 
         to risk analysis, especially where large investments are required. 
         We use Monte Carlo simulation to capture the uncertainty around key assumptions, 
         and the resulting impact on the financial outcomes that we care about.</li><br>
    <li> <b class = "blue-grey-text">How do we ensure successful execution?</b><br>
        We help you think through the right governance 
        structure for sucessful execution of the program.</li>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
Deep market understanding is the foundation for developing a robust strategy. 
Self-driving cars provide a good analogy. 2005 was a breakthrough year. 
Stanley (pictured above) was the first driverless car to complete a 100+ mile course through 
the desert. It wasn't the most powerful or fastest car. It was the car with 
the most sophisticated ability to sense the external environment, separate signal from
noise, and make sense of incoming information.

<p>
Multimodal customer research (e.g., interviews + customer survey + focus groups) is 
typically the ideal solution if time and budget allows. The right combination of research
tools depends on the context. However, here's one effective model:
    <ol>
        <li>Interviews - small number of interviews to help identify key issues</li>
        <li>Survey - research survey to quantify key issues, and identify relevant segments</li>
        <li>Focus group - test specific new ideas with different customer segments</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<br>
<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
Most firms will outsource most steps in this process to a market research firm. 
We will make a decision on which steps to outsource
based on the specific business situation. If needed, we have the capabilities to execute 
the entire market research process in-house.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
Defining the value that we're providing to customers is the foundation of product strategy.

Consider Tesla and Toyota. 

Tesla is focused on delivering customer value through product leadership. It focuses on open communication and innovation.

Toyota is known for operational efficiency and quality control.  It focuses on the quest for continuous improvement through Kaizen.

The way that each firm delivers value is fundamentally different.  </p>

<p>

For every product we need to be clear about whether aiming to provide the best product, the best solution, 

the lowest cost offering, or the most convenient offering. 

</p>

<br>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 1:</b> 
    We start by defining the value that we're delivering to customers. 
    This has to be defined in relation to the value that competitors are delivery, 
    so customer and competitor analysis if often a component of this phase. 
</p>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 2:</b> 
    We next consider the processes and capabilities needed to deliver that value to customers. 
    We would typically assess existing processes and capabilities, and identify gaps that need to be closed.
</p>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 3:</b>
    Finally, we aim to translate the product strategy into an executable product roadmap. 
    In most cases, we won't be starting with a blank sheet of paper. 
    We need to integrate top-down strategic considerations with product developments that may either 
    be in-flight or may have been committed to publicly or to indiviudal clients.

<p>
Technology strategy should follow business strategy. For cost leaders, technology can
enable further automation of routine processes. For product leaders, technology can be 
a primary driver of innovation. The key focus should be on how technology can advance 
our business strategy and the level of impact that it can have. While this sounds obvious, 
it's easy to get distracted by the "hype cycle" and focus on the latest technology 
developments, regardless of their potential for business impact.

<p>
   Transformation Management should be much more than a simple rebarnding of traditional
   program management. The fundamental difference is that program management is primarily focused
   on delivering on-time and on-budget; transformation management is focused on
   delivering desired business outcomes. In practice, the difference is that Transoformation
   Management activities are designed top-down to meet the needs of senior executives. 
   (In contrast, program management tends to be designed bottom-up, based on the 
   indiviudal project objectives.)

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
    We can help you create a Transformation Management Office from scratch, 
    or improve the effectiveness of your existing transformation management activities. 
    We use a player-coach model where we'll be actively involved in the execution of 
    transformation while we're designing upgraded processes and building new tools. 
    Large programs with many projects can carry a heavy administrative burden to 
    track progress and financial results. We can develop highly-automted tools that will
    minimize the administrative burden.

The reasons are complex, but academic studies point to two major reasons: post-deal integration planning and execution and the quality of pre-deal market due diligence. In a competitive M&A market, inadequate due diligence often leads to an optimistic evluation of the target firm. Hence, the winner's curse! We believe in a hypothesis-driven approach that stress-tests the deal thesis through focused customer research.
