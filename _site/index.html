<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 1:</b> 
We begin by assessing your current growth trajectory across major business units. 
We analyze the sources of growth, including share of wallet expansion, new customer acquisition, new products, and new markets.

<p>
<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 2:</b> 
Next, we survey senior executives with targeted questions to understand the strength of existing 
growth processes and capabilities.

<b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 3:</b> 
Finally, we share the quantiative and qualitative analysis with senior executives, along with preliminary 
perspectives on growth opportunities. We refine the prioritization of these growth opportunities in collaboration 
with senior executives.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>

<p>
Most organizations only look a few years into the future. 

Scenario planning provides a long-term perspective. 

It's about looking a decade or more into the future, exploring possible futures,  
and assessing their long-term implications - both threats and opportunities - for an organization.
</p>

<br>
<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
We have a robust, structured scenario development process that has proven highly effective 
within large organizations. At the heart of the process is the framing of scenarios around 
the most critical uncertainties faced by the organization. The key steps are as follows:
<p>
<ol>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Define the key decision</b> that needs to be made</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Identify key forces</b> in environment</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Prioritize external forces</b> based on their importance and uncertainty</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Develop scenarios</b> based on combinations of key forces</li>
    <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Identify implications</b> for the organization</li>
</ol>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
    Strategy is fundamentally about making choices that create a differentiated 
    market position. It sounds easy, but is very hard in practice. Why? 
    Because it involves challenging trade-offs. A shift in strategy requires not 
    only deciding "what to do", but also deciding "what not to do". 
    The organization must put in place a set of inter-locking activities that support 
    their strategic choices. The self-reinforcing nature of the entire activity system 
    makes it hard for competitors to replicate.  
    
</p>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
The core of our strategy development process involves addressing five strategic questions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>What are our goals?</li> 
    <li>Where will we play?</li> 
    <li>How will we win?</li> 
    <li>What capabilities must be in place?</li> 
    <li>What management systems are required?</li> 
</ol>

<p>
    We take a flexible and highly collaborative approach, involving all of the key 
    stakeholders in a process which is adapted to your specific needs. At the heart of 
    the process we define strategic choices, identify key assumptions, and test those
    assumptions through in-depth research and analysis.
    Please get in touch to learn about how we've used this approach to align leadership teams around a compelling strategy.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>We believe there are five key components that need to be part of any business case:
    <ol>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Value</b>: how our offer will create compelling value in the marketplace</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Demand</b>: validation that there is a critical mass of paying customers </li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Supply</b>: capabilities required to develop the offer</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Unit economics</b>: ability to deliver the offer profitability</li>
        <li><b class = "blue-grey-text">Go-to-market</b>: plan to reach, engage, and win target customer cost-effectively </li>
    </ol>
</p><p>
    Most business cases focus heavily on the supply side - 
    detailing the internal costs of building the new product or business. 
    We take a venture capital perspective to business cases - 
    VC firms focus heavily on customer demand and unit economics.
</p>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
In addition to addressing the questions above, 
we make sure that we address the context for business challenge or opportunity 
that we're addressing. We'll also typically develop a complex financial model that 
supports the business case, and develop a givernance approach that will help to ensure 
sucessful execution of the program. 

Financial impact can be challenging to estimate if we're at the early stages of 
defining the offering or if there's significant market undertainty. 
To address this, we believe in the importance of taking a sophisticated approach 
to risk analysis, especially where large investments are required. 
We use Monte Carlo simulation to capture the uncertainty around key assumptions, 
and the resulting impact on the financial outcomes that we care about.

<p>
Deep market understanding is the foundation for developing a robust strategy. Many firms
have a capability to scan the market, but it often lacks two components. Firstly, market analysis needs to be informed by current business performance and focused accordingly. Secondly, we need the ability to drive insight by testing specific market hypotheses. 

To underscore the importanceof market analysis, we like to use an anlaogy  - the 2005 DARPA challenge for the first driverless car to complete a 100+ mile course through the desert. It wasn't the car with best engine that won, it was the car with the most sophisticated ability to sense the external environment, separate signal from noise, and make sense of incoming information. Stanley, Stanford University's customized Volkswagen, was the winning car.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
Multimodal customer research (e.g., interviews + customer survey + focus groups) is 
typically the ideal solution if time and budget allows. The right combination of research
tools depends on the context. However, here's one effective model:
    <ol>
        <li>Interviews - small number of interviews to help identify key issues</li>
        <li>Survey - research survey to quantify key issues, and identify relevant segments</li>
        <li>Focus group - test specific new ideas with different customer segments</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<br>
<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
Most firms will outsource most steps in this process to a market research firm. 
We will make a decision on which steps to outsource
based on the specific business situation. If needed, we have the capabilities to execute 
the entire market research process in-house.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
Defining the value that we're providing to customers is the foundation of product strategy.

Consider Tesla and Toyota. 

Tesla is focused on delivering customer value through product leadership. It focuses on open communication and innovation.

Toyota is known for operational efficiency and quality control.  It focuses on the quest for continuous improvement through Kaizen.

The way that each firm delivers value is fundamentally different.  </p>

<p>

For every product we need to be clear about whether aiming to provide the best product, the best solution, 

the lowest cost offering, or the most convenient offering. 

</p>

<br>

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text"> Our Approach </h6>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 1:</b> 
    We start by defining the value that we're delivering to customers. 
    This has to be defined in relation to the value that competitors are delivery, 
    so customer and competitor analysis if often a component of this phase. 
</p>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 2:</b> 
    We next consider the processes and capabilities needed to deliver that value to customers. 
    We would typically assess existing processes and capabilities, and identify gaps that need to be closed.
</p>

<p><b class = "blue-grey-text">Step 3:</b>
    Finally, we aim to translate the product strategy into an executable product roadmap. 
    In most cases, we won't be starting with a blank sheet of paper. 
    We need to integrate top-down strategic considerations with product developments that may either 
    be in-flight or may have been committed to publicly or to indiviudal clients.

Go-to-market strategy should be aligned with our growth objectives. The focus will differe significantly depending on the extent to which we expect growth to come from share of wallet epansion, new client acquisition, adjacent market, or entirely new markets.

<h6 class = "blue-grey-text">Our Perspective</h6>

<p>
Half of M&A transactions don't create shareholder value. The reasons are complex, but academic studies point to two major reasons: post-deal integration planning and execution and the quality of pre-deal market due diligence. In a competitive M&A market, inadequate due diligence often leads to an optimistic evluation of the target firm. Hence, the winner's curse! We believe in a hypothesis-driven approach that stress-tests the deal thesis through focused customer research.
