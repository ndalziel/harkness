<p>
Growth is a capability, like Financial Management, that requires robust processes and 
capabilities. The growth diagnostic helps us to understand where we have opportunities to 
drive incremental growth, and where we lack the processes and capabilities to drive growth. We organize the required capabilities and process into twelve different categories.

<b>Step 1:</b> We begin by analyzing the current growth trajectory by business unit. We break growth down to understand the sources of growth, including share of wallet expansion, new customer acquisition, new products, and new markets.
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> Next we survey senior executives with targeted questions to understand the strength of existing growth processes and capabilities. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> Finally, we share the quantiative and qualitative analysis with senior executives, along with preliminary perspectives on growth opportunities. We refine the prioritization of these growth opportunities in collaboration with senior executives.

<p>
Many organizations have a planning process where they look a few years into the future. Scenario planning is fundamentally different. It's about looking a decade or more into the future and exploring possible futures and their long-term implications for our organization. 

We have a robust scenario development process that has proven highly effective within large organizations. At the heart of the process is building sceanrios around the most critical uncertainties. The transportation scenario matrix illustrates what this can look like in practice - we can see that the cost of energy and the desire for physical versus virtual interaction. The most appropriate framing of scenarios depends on how they're been used by the organization - part if the art and science of scenario planning is working through a structured process to reach a set of scenarios that provides new thinking about new threats and opportunities that the organization may face in the future.
</p>

<h6 class = "center-align">Illustrative Transportation Scenarios</h6>
<img class="responsive-img center" src="assets/images/scenarios2.jpg">

<h6 class = "grey-text text-darken-1"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
We have a standard and accelerated approach to scenario planning. The key steps to the standard approach are as follows:

1. Define the key decision that needs to be made
2. Identify and research key forces in environment
3. Prioritize the external foces based on their importance and uncertainty
5. Develop scenarios
6. Identify implications for our organization

Please contact us to learn more about how we've used this approach in practice.

<p>Strategy is fundamentally about making choices that create a differentiated market position. It sounds easy, but is very hard in practice. Why? Because it involves challenging trade-offs. A shift in strategy requires not only deciding "what to do", but also deciding "what not to do". To illustrate the challenge, let's look at an illustration of Vanguard's activity system:
</p>

<img class="responsive-img center" src="assets/images/vanguard.gif">
<h6 class="center-align"><i>Source: "What is Strategy?", Harvard Business Review, Michael Porter
</i></h6>
<p>
Vanguard has put in place a set of inter-loacking activities that support their pursuit of a low-cost investing strategy. Given the long-term trend towards investing in low-cost index funds, other firms have have tried to gain share in passive funds. So, how has Vanguard been able to maintain it's #1 position in index funds? Because Vanguard's success is not due to a handful of strategic choices - it's due to the self-reinforcing nature of an entire activity system. Traditional asset managers have a completely different activity system that aligns well with a focus on active management, but is ill-suited to competing head-on with Vanguard. 
</p>

<h6 class = "grey-text text-darken-1"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
The core of our strategy development process involves addressing five strategic questions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>What are our goals?</li> 
    <li>Where will we play?</li> 
    <li>How will we win?</li> 
    <li>What capabilities must be in place?</li> 
    <li>What management systems are required?</li> 
</ol>

<p>These questions are addressed using a four-step approach:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Define strategic choices</li>
    <li>Identify key asumptions ("what we need to believe") for each strategy choices</li>
    <li>Test key assumptions</li>
    <li>Articulate Strategy</li>
</ol>

<p>We take a flexible and highly collaborative approach, involving all of the key stakeholders in a process which is adapted to your specific needs. Please get in touch to learn about how we've used this approach to align leadership teams around a compelling strategy.

<p>We believe there are five key components to any business case. Most business cases focus heavily on the supply side - specifically, the internal costs of building the new product or business. We take a venture capital perspective to business cases - VC firms typically focus much more on customer demand and unit economics.
</p>

<img class="responsive-img center" src="assets/images/bizcase.png">

<h6 class = "grey-text text-darken-1"> Our Approach </h6>

<p>
In addition to addressing the questions above, we make sure that we address the context for business challenge or opportunity that we're addressing. We'll also typically develop a complex financial model that supports the business case, and develop a givernance approach that will help to ensure sucessful execution of the program. 

Financial impact can be challenging to estimate if we're at the early stages of defining the offering or if there's significant market undertainty. To address this, we believe in the importance of taking a sophisticated approach to risk analysis, especially where large investments are required. We use Monte Carlo simulation to capture the uncertainty around key assumptions, and the resulting impact on the financial outcomes that we care about.

<p>
Deep market understanding is the foundation for developing a robust strategy. Many firms
have a capability to scan the market, but it often lacks two components. Firstly, market analysis needs to be informed by current business performance and focused accordingly. Secondly, we need the ability to drive insight by testing specific market hypotheses. 

To underscore the importanceof market analysis, we like to use an anlaogy  - the 2005 DARPA challenge for the first driverless car to complete a 100+ mile course through the desert. It wasn't the car with best engine that won, it was the car with the most sophisticated ability to sense the external environment, separate signal from noise, and make sense of incoming information. Stanley, Stanford University's customized Volkswagen, was the winning car.

We begin by working with you to agree on the the hypotheses that we want to test, and developing a list of established and emerging competitors that are of particular interest. To gther market insights, we leverage our extensive partnerships. We work with industry experts to gather deep insight into the market and key competitors, and we use a third-party market intelligence platform to source a broad range of market data and market reports. We'll share key insights as we progress through the research phase so that we can refine our focus to make sure we extract the most valuable market insights.

Our approach follows the standard customer research approach, but have a more flexibility around our approach than most consulting firms. Most firms will outsource most steps in this process to a market research firm. We will make a decision on which steps to outsource based on the specific business situation. If needed, we have the capabilities to execute the entire market research process in-house.

<p>
Product Strategy starts by clearly defining the value that we're providing to customers. At the highest level, we're either aiming to provide the best product, the best solution, the lowest cost or the most convenient offering. We then need to articulate how we're going to deliver the value to customers. 

As an example, consider Tesla and Toyota. Tesla is focused on delivering customer value through product leadership, while Toyota is known for operational efficiency and quality control. The way that each firm delivers value is very different. Tesla focuses on open communication and innovation, while Toyota focuses on the quest for continuous improvement through Kaizen.
</p>

<img class="responsive-img center" src="assets/images/valueleadership.png">

<h6 class = "grey-text text-darken-1"> Our Approach </h6>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> We start by defining the value that we're delivering to customers. This has to be defined in relation to the value that competitors are delivery, so customer and competitor analysis if often a component of this phase. 

<b>Step 2:</b> We next consider the processes and capabilities needed to deliver that value to customers. We would typically assess existing processes and capabilities, and identify gaps that need to be closed.

<b>Step 3:</b>Finally, we aim to translate the product strategy into an executable product roadmap. In most cases, we won't be starting with a blank sheet of paper. We need to integrate top-down strategic considerations with product developments that may either be in-flight or may have been committed to publicly or to indiviudal clients.

Go-to-market strategy should be aligned with our growth objectives. The focus will differe significantly depending on the extent to which we expect growth to come from share of wallet epansion, new client acquisition, adjacent market, or entirely new markets.

Half of M&A transactions don't create shareholder value. The reasons are complex, but academic studies point to two major reasons: post-deal integration planning and execution and the quality of pre-deal market due diligence. In a competitive M&A market, inadequate due diligence often leads to an optimistic evluation of the target firm. Hence, the winner's curse! We believe in a hypothesis-driven approach that stress-tests the deal thesis through focused customer research.
