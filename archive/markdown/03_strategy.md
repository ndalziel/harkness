##### Our Perspective
Strategy is fundamentally about making choices that create a differentiated market position. It sounds easy, but is very hard in practice. Why? Because it involves challenging trade-offs. A shift in strategy requires not only deciding "what to do", but also deciding "what not to do". To illustrate the challenge, let's look at an illustration of Vanguard's activity system:

Vanguard has put in place a set of inter-loacking activities that support their pursuit of a low-cost investing strategy. Given the long-term trend towards investing in low-cost index funds, other firms have have tried to gain share in passive funds. So, how has Vanguard been able to maintain it's #1 position in index funds? Because Vanguard's success is not due to a handful of strategic choices - it's due to the self-reinforcing nature of an entire activity system. Traditional asset managers have a completely different activity system that aligns well with a focus on active management, but is ill-suited to competing head-on with Vanguard. 

##### Our Approach

The core of our strategy development process involves addressing five strategic questions:
1. What are our goals?
2. Where will we play?
3. How will we win?
4. What capabilities must be in place?
5. What management systems are required?

These questions are addressed using a four-step approach:
1. Define strategic choices
2. Identify key asumptions ("what we need to believe") for each strategy choices
3. Test key assumptions
4. Articulate Strategy

We take a flexible and highly collaborative approach, involving all of the key stakeholders in a process which is adapted to your specific needs. Please get in touch to learn about how we've used this approach to align leadership teams around a compelling strategy.
