title: Commercial Due Diligence
---

##### Our Perspective

Half of M&A transactions don't create shareholder value. The reasons are complex, but academic studies point to two major reasons: post-deal integration planning and execution and the quality of pre-deal market due diligence. In a competitive M&A market, inadequate due diligence often leads to an optimistic evluation of the target firm. Hence, the winner's curse! We believe in a hypothesis-driven approach that stress-tests the deal thesis through focused customer research.
