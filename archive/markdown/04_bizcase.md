title: Business Case Development

##### Our Perspective
 We believe there are five key components to any business case. Most business cases focus heavily on the supply side - specifically, the internal costs of building the new product or business. We take a venture capital perspective to business cases - VC firms typically focus much more on customer demand and unit economics.

##### Our Approach

In addition to addressing the questions above, we make sure that we address the context for business challenge or opportunity that we're addressing. We'll also typically develop a complex financial model that supports the business case, and develop a givernance approach that will help to ensure sucessful execution of the program. 

Financial impact can be challenging to estimate if we're at the early stages of defining the offering or if there's significant market undertainty. To address this, we believe in the importance of taking a sophisticated approach to risk analysis, especially where large investments are required. We use Monte Carlo simulation to capture the uncertainty around key assumptions, and the resulting impact on the financial outcomes that we care about.
