<h6 class = "grey-text text-darken-1">Our Perspective</h6>
<p>
Deep market understanding is the foundation for developing a robust strategy. Many firms
have a capability to scan the market, but it often lacks two components. Firstly, market analysis needs to be informed by current business performance and focused accordingly. Secondly, we need the ability to drive insight by testing specific market hypotheses. 

To underscore the importanceof market analysis, we like to use an anlaogy  - the 2005 DARPA challenge for the first driverless car to complete a 100+ mile course through the desert. It wasn't the car with best engine that won, it was the car with the most sophisticated ability to sense the external environment, separate signal from noise, and make sense of incoming information. Stanley, Stanford University's customized Volkswagen, was the winning car.
