<p>
Deep market understanding is the foundation for developing a robust strategy. 
Self-driving cars provide a good analogy. 2005 was a breakthrough year. 
Stanley (pictured above) was the first driverless car to complete a 100+ mile course through 
the desert. It wasn't the most powerful or fastest car. It was the car with 
the most sophisticated ability to sense the external environment, separate signal from
noise, and make sense of incoming information.
